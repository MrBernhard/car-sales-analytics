# 🚗 Car sales analytics project
The idea of this project came from a discussion with some friends in which we were trying to understand how the sales of Chinese brands' cars in Mexico were increasing compared to other brands, as well as which was the main driver for the consumer to prefer one brand over another.\

From this idea, I split the project into the following stages, to make it easier to work on without losing focus:
- [x] Data aquisition
- [x] Data visualization
- [ ] Data analysis

## 📡 Data Aquisition
For this stage, I started looking for already created datasets that I could ingest into a Jupyter notebook, either through API requests or through CSV upload. However, I found some roadblocks like:
- Data not being up to date
- Data blocked behind paywall
- 

## 📊 Data Visualization

## ⚙️ Data Analysis
